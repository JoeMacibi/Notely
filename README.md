# Book Manager

Book Manager is a small Spring Boot application designed to manage a collection of books by providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It serves as an example of how to build a RESTful API using Spring Boot for managing a specific resource, in this case, books.

## Features

- Retrieve a list of all books
- Get a book by its ID
- Create a new book
- Delete a book

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database (in-memory)
- Maven (for build and dependency management)

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot project structure:

- `com.example.bookmanager.model`: Contains the `Book` model class representing a book entity.
- `com.example.bookmanager.repository`: Contains the `BookRepository` interface for database operations.
- `com.example.bookmanager.service`: Contains the `BookService` class with the business logic for managing books.
- `com.example.bookmanager.controller`: Contains the `BookController` class exposing the API endpoints.
